# Qi (Chi) lib
It's not a framework, just a collection of utilities.
*PHP >= 5.3 only!*

## Features (Chi Mantra)
- Tested with phpunit (help me to 100% cover).
- Full NameSpaced: namespace Qi\*;
- Dead Simple to Use, just require 'lib/autoload.php'; and you're ready to go.
- Very Small libray (don't try to be a Silver Bullet).
- Maded to small developers with small projects.
- Fast. Just load what's needed for the request, using autoload.
- PHP friendly. Don't try to be Java, Ruby or Python. It's PHP!
- Social with others libraries. Don't try to reinvent the wheel when it's already well done like Analog, Symphony ClassLoader, vfsStream, PHPUnit, MeekroDB, etc.
- MySql/sqlite/MongoDB only! If you use PostgreSQL or Oracle, this lib is probably too small for you.
- No external dependency. (except for testing)
- [Composer](http://packagist.org) support
